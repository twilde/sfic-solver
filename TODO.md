# TODO

## Ideas for later

- A mode that screens candidate unit masters against decoded unit keys.
- `--avoid-file` for the generator.
- Generate the `cores` list from an exported CSV of the key matrix.
- After 2026-11-19 (`ubuntu-latest` fully on Ubuntu 26.04), replace the pinned
  runner images in CI with `ubuntu-latest` (see D14/D15 in docs/design.md).
- Configurable keyway rules (cut depth range, an explicit allowed-cut set per
  pin) so the tools work for other systems. The pin count is already
  configurable (D22 in docs/design.md).
